xii PREFACE.

“vetusta chronica.”* Since, however, the early portion 01 our
Chronicle be but a compilation from other historians, it may be
asked if Fordun did not derive these notices srom the same
common sources from which they were introduced into the
Chronicle of Melrose; but such was not the case, as will ap-
pear by a comparison of those passages which have undergone
abridgement or alteration in being transcribed from the Eng-
lish originali

Wyntoun cites some information from “ cornyklys awld,”‡
a reference which, as the learned Maepherson observes is ‘⁶ ap-
parently the Chronicle of Melrose.”§

The Chronicle of Lanercost contains many sentences trans-

* cribed from that of Melrose; and a comparison of the two

leads to the conclusion that the copy was made by the English
monks from the manuscript now preserved in the Cottonian
library. 11 From these observations it appears, that although,
on the one hand, we must give our ancestors credit for possess-

ing a considerable share of the genuine spirit 01 literary accom-
modation, in thus transmitting into various parts of Scotland, if
’ 001 1010 England, a volume tc 'which they must have attached

† For instance, Fordun, vol. i. p. 270, l. 2, when speaking 01 150 prisonem whom Wil-
liam 150 Conqueror requested 1ο 50 freed, mentions “ Vulnotumregis Haroldi germanum,
quern a pueritia in custodia,” obviously omittinga verb necessary for the completion 01 150
sense. The same words are 10 the Chronicle 01 Melrose, p· 59, 1. 4; 501 150 original
authority, Hovedsn, supplies the necessary verb, “tenuerat’' 101. 264, 1. 23.

ξ Vol. ii. p. 464. .

1 The Chronicle ο1 Lanercost details the ravages committed 10 cumberland by Alexan-
der the Second in 150 same words 00 those employed by the monk 01 Melrose; but 101010-
ing the folio 01 his original 50 has accidentally omitted 0 word, reading-“uon magistri
sed ministri malitise‚” instead of—“ non magistri militiae, sed ministri malitioe,” p. 123; thus
failing tc preserve a monastic playing upon words 100 much 10 accordance with the tacte
01150 period 10 50 intentionally omitted. It occurs again 01 p. 246.
