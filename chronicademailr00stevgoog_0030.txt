no small value; yet we are compelled, on the other, to own
that their habits of original thinking and observation were
proportionally weakened by thus slavishly adopting sentimenta
and views in some instanceS, opposed to what must have been
their original impressione· We also see the utility of tracing,
as. far as possible, to their source, the various materials from
which the early portion of this, as of almost all our chronicles,
are formed3 of noting those peculiarities arising from time,
locality, orother adventitious circumstances which maytend
to throw a colouring over the testimony of the narrat0r3 and
of distinguishing that portion of the history which is a compila-
tion from anterior writers, whose works are preserved, from that
which is the result of the historian’s own observation, or which,
from creditable authority, he may think worthy of -being re-
corded. If such writers as Hoveden, Knyghton, Walsingham,
Matthew of Westminster, and many others, both English and
Scottish, were subjected to such ascrutiny, the advantage of the
system would soon be obvious; their bulky volumes would
dwin'dle into pageS, and their authority, as historical evidence,
be confined within thirty or forty years anterior to the period
in which the respective authors lived. The only use to which
we could turn the rejected matter, would be to afford various
readings for the works which form the basis of each compila-
tion3 thus, sor instance, the manuscripts of Florence of Worces-
ter would furnish a better textos Asser’s life of Alfred3 the
manuscripts of Hoveden might be collated for a new edition

¹ of Simeon of Durham and Benedictus Abbas; and the copies

of Walsingham might serve to compensate for the loss of all
save the one existing manuscript of the valuable chronicles of

Troldowe and Blaneford.
