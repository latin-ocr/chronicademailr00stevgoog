¹ The locality of “sibernithi'’ has been asubjeet of controversy. See Hailcs, i. 15; Clamas, i. tle.
As some of the arguments there adduced are founded upon the meaning of the word “ gewaede,”
which occurs in the account given in the Sue. Cleon. l may remark, that Gibson is in error when
he states, that it is expressive of the river Tweed; instead of which, it is the common Saron word
for a ford, 'and is frequent in the languages of the North. Ilre, ii. 1024. Itis common in names
of places, such as Langvvath, Meam. Anglic. ii. 60⁵2, ota Sandwath, p. 151; Horretb, p. 507,
and, in p. 903, mention is made of a ‘⁶ villa quae dicitur Watlr.” It subsequently became peculim
to the north of England. Canrden's Renmins, p. 100; Slinner, in voce. Places ending in ‘⁸ wartb,”
which seems in several instances a corruption of “ wath,” are generally situated on the banks of a
river, near a ford. Creten Gloss. ii. 241. No argument, as to locality, can therefore be deduoed
from this word. ln compliance with a wish expressed by Lord Helles, i. 16, the following MSS.
of authors who mention this meeting have been consulted‚ but without conferring any advantage
upon their respective texts. For starem os Worccster, the Cottom'an MS. Vitell. E. xiii.; for
Radulfus dc Diaeta, the Cottonian MS. Claud. E. iii. The same eventis recorded in a short
Chronicle preserved in the rlrundel MS.. 220; see also for accounts of the same event, Hoseden,
sol. 260. b.; Hen. ‹eruntr'ngdom fol. 211. b.; W. Malmerbur. fol. 583 Wynf. i. 2703 Alwood, cap.
xxii. when discussing this event, cites the narratives of ordericus V italas, the Regisierosdbt'ngdon,
(Cott. tls. Claud. B. vi), and the Arronymoas Chronicle in the Cott. MS. Vitell. Α. xx. ¹ 'l'be
words here inserted within brackets are no longer legiblc in the MS.. but are given from the eddon
of Gale. Since the period of its publication, they have been so carequy crased horn the vellum,
that there does not nov remain the vestige of a single letter. See M. Pan's, p. 5; Ingalsas, edit.
