viii PREFACE.

however much the expression commented upon, when viewed
under the influence of modern prejudices, might seem a proof
of an English origin, it could not at first couvey any such idea.

·· That the English authorship of this early part of the history
may appear the more obvious, Nicolson* argues that the mo-
nastery of Melrose itself seems to have been in the hands of the
English, from the fact that Waltheof, brother to Henry earl of
Northumberland, and of Simon earl of Northampton, in whom
he recognises only the scion of a southern family, was made
abbot of Melrose3 forgetting that his mother, the countess Ma-
tilda’y became the wife of David, prince of Cumberland,‘who
afterwards ascendedthe throne of Scotland.

The same writer saysss that “in the year 1157, the abbot of
Dundrainan‚ or some of his countrymen, was most probably the
scribe3 this being the accountwhich he gives of the Scotch king's
homage: Rex‘Malcolmus Scotorum veniens ad regern Angliae

ι Henricum apud Cestriam devenit homo suur, co modo quo avus

suus fuerat homo veteris regis Henrici‚aa1tr's omnibus tiaratae
tt'ous suis.” Unfortunately, however, for this theory, the pas-
sage has been transcribed verbatim from Hoveden.§ He further
states that this is not noticed in the Oxford edition, “ but only
in the manuscript copy which they have in Scotland,” but the
passage is in the Oxford editionll

Taar the present Chronicle is the production of a series of
writers who were inmates of Melrose, appears from a variety of
passages scattered throughout the following pagea a few of
