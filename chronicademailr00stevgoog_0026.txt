PREFACE. ix

the doubt which has recently been expressed, whether the pre-
sent compilation be indeed the Chronicle of Melrose. An in-
spection of the fac-similes exhibiting the diversities of waiting
which the manuscript presentS, will evince that we cannot
ascribe its compilation to any individual author, but that a
century at least must have elapsed between the time when the
prologue was written, and that which saw recorded the exploits
of prince Edward in the Holy Laud. Within these periodo
we distinguish in the manuscripts numerous variations in the
penmanship, correct representations of the greater number of
which accompany the present volume; the original, however,
exhibits some minuter intermediate steps, which it was not con-
sidered necessary to engrave. We have, therefore, no reason
to expect any information derived from contemporaneous autho-
rity until many centuries after the period from which the first
scribe commenced his labours3 and since he informs us that
his annals are compiled from various sources, it may not be
impertinent to inquire what these sources are. If it can be
shown that the compiler had before him a manuscript of the
Saron Chronicle, and that we can trace vestiges ofa direct
translation from that work, made at a period when the Saxon
language was in common use, we divest our annals of the cha
racter of a mere compilation, and fix upon thern a new and addi-
tional value. But since there are so many sentences, we might
rather say pages, in ‘which Simeon of Durham, himself a fol-
lower of the same authority, is directly transcribed or abridged,
