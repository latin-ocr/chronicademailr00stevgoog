APPENDIX.

Alter this a continuation seems to have been made in the ensuing reign of
. Alexander the Third, arrd it concludes with these words:

. ‘⁶ Nomen habet petris, utinam petris ecta sequatur
Filius, Albaniue qnimodo sceptra tenet.''

Alter this Ilindno more of this elegiae verse, although there are frequent quo·
tatione ol poetry interspersed in the continuation of Fordun, which are generally
in Hexameter verse.

No part of this poem seems to hare been known to Fordun, ns may be pre-
sumed by that part of the Scottiehrouicon, which he himself linished‚ having no
extracta from it 3 vide Fordun‚ edit. Gale et Heerne.

The first pert, concluding with Mecbeth and Lulech, was interpolated in the

Chronicle of Mehose, and was known to W[yntcwn], who has interwoven it

through his work.
The additions of the second edition were also inserted in the Chronicle of

Mehose. ·

Johannes Abbas Sancti Petri de Burgo' says, sub anno 975, that the Chro-
nicon Elegiacum wes composed by Alred, who was bred up with Henry, sou os
David the F iret, and he may have composed the first part, or perhaps added the
second part, and hence got the credit os being author of the whole.
