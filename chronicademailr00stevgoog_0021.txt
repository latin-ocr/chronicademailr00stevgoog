have in Scotland.” Strange to say, these very words arcto be
found in the Oxford edition* Yet one of his subsequent ob-
servations seems intended to prove that the Scottish copies are
less copious than the decried English edition, for he tells us that
‘all “these manuscript copies in Scotlandi end with the words
‘Obiit Adam de Kilcontath [l. Kilconcath] comes de Karryc in
Actonia [l. Aeconia], cujus uxorem [Diuam nominei] comitissam
de Karryc, postea junior Robertus de Bruys accepit in‘ spon-
sam3' ” which demonstrates that they contain about two pages
” less ‚than is given by the Oxsord edition. He then adds the
colophon appended to these transcripta, which states that “Haec
est vera copia antiquae Cronicae de Melros in Scotia, inchoata
per abbatem de Dundranan, ab anno 735, continuata per varios
ad annum 1270. Autographum extat in Bibliotheca Do. Ro-
berti Cotton, militis, apud Westmonasterium.” He attempts
to obscure this clear statement byobserving, “ Now, ¹though
this is said to be a transcript of that in Cotton's Library, yet he

This last l have had an opportunity os examining3 it isa small quarto, marked F. vii, 23,
formerly belonging to Sir James Baliour, by whom it was transcribed from the original.
It ends in the same manner as those mentioned by Nicolson, aster which follows the
colophon oi the transcriber, as given in the text As it was in the possession of the
University in the year 1700, itis not improbable that Nicolson made his memoranda
from this copy, when on a visit to his “ worthy friend, Mr Robert Wudrow, library·keeper
at Glasgow.”
