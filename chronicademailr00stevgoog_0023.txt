collating this transcript with the original. ›That this transcript
has not undergone a careful revision appears almost certain, for
in more than one instance where the copyist had committed an
obvious blunder, Fulman, observing the fault, has proposed as
a conjectural emendation the very words which stand in the
Cottonian original.

The author, or rather the authors, of this Chronicle cannot
now be ascertained. It has hitherto been customary to ascribe
its commencement to an abbot of Duudreuan in Galloway, but
this is one of the errors into which the faulty transcript perpe-
tuated by the edition of 1684 has led all subsequent writers*
The true reading of the memorandum upon which it is founded
is as follows :—“ Memorandum, quod abbas de Duudraynand
mutuavit cronica de Melrose, iu quibus suerunt xiiij. quaterni,
folio vxx et xix.”† At a subsequent period the abbot procured the
loan of the remaining portion, “ Abbas de Duudrainan mutuo
accepit reliquam partem cronicorum istorum.”‡ In the first
of these quotations the word mutuavit has been mistaken for
inchoavit, and hence the origin of that claim upon our gratitude
hitherto exercised by the abbot of Duudreuan. In this, as in
other investigations of a similar nature, it is much easier to
produce negative than positive testimony; aud having removed
the abbot of Duudreuan from hia eminence, the Editor must
confess that he is unable to place any other claimant in his stead.
