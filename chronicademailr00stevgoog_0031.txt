xiv PREFACE.

The Chronicon Rythmicum, which has been. introduced into
the Chronicle of Mehose by a hand of the early partos the
fourteenth century, must be considered an interpolation, and
is totally unconnected with the history in which it is found; aas
such, it has been separated from the text, and placed at the end

' of the volume* The same has been done with the contents os

fol. 53 of the manuscripti containing memoranda, which, in
an extended form, have been inserted in their respective places
in the text.

When, or by what means, the manuscript now in the British
Museum came into the hands of Sir Robert Cotton, cannot
now be ascertained. The Editor is inclined to think that by
some accident it was carried off from Melrose at a periodis
not anterior to, at least immediately after, the Reformation.
Had it been preserved there when Viscount Haddington had
a grant of the abbey-lands, it is probable that he would have
preserved it along with the splendid collection of charters1
which came into his possession upon that occasion, or that some
extracts from it would have been found in his “Collections of ¹
Charters, Evidents, and AntiquitieS,” now in the Advocates’

’ P. 223. Maepherson, in a nota in his copy of the Chronicle oi Melrose, printed p.
236, and in his edition oi Wyntoun, vol. ii. p. 471, considers that this metrical chronicle
is the productiones Ailred oi Rievaux. Pinlcerton, in his Enquiry into the History of
Scotland, vol. ii. pass, has printed various readings and additions from the Bodleian MS.
c. iv. 3, which he says is of the thirteenth century5 but unless art. 17 of the Catalogue be
added by a later hand, wc must conclude that the writiugis posterior to 1356.

† Appendix L

ss Many hundred original charters, from tha time of David the First to the Reforma-
tion, have lately been secured by Thomas Thomson, esquire, Depnty Clerk Register for
Scotland3 and these, together with' the addition of others from the Chartularies of Mel·
rose, ars in the course of publication by that gentleman. lt is probable that when that
most important work shall appear, the abbey of Meirose will have more numerous literary·
monuments of its former grandeur than any ecclesiastical establishment in Seotland.
