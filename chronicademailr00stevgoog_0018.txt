PREFACE.

Anonosr the scanty documents illustrative of the early history
of Scotland which have reached us, a distinguished rarik is to
be assigned to the Chronicle of Mehose. The Chronicon Sanctae
Crucis, which alone can' compete with it in antiquity, is inferior
in detail as well as in extent; and its age gives itan undisputed
advantage over the writings of Fordun‚ Wyntoun, Barbour, and
Bower. The era, as well as the locality, of its composition places
it above the chronicles of Hemingford, Gray‚ and that of the
monks of Lanercost, how valuable soever these annals may be in
the illustration of the later periods of our history. Itis to the
pages of this chronicle alone that we must advert for the general
history of Scotland during several reigns, as narrated by Scotch-
men3 and, excepting the brief notices of the Chronicle of Holy-
rood‚ we have no other contemporaneous annalist until we
arrive at Barbour and Fordun‚ both of whom wrote about a cen-
tury after the abrupt termination of the Chronicle of Mehose.
The present edition, like the former, is sounded solely upon
the authority of the Cottonian manuscript, Faustina, B. ix. It is
a question of extreme importance whether that manuscript be an
unique copy, or whether the text which it supplies might not
be corrected or augmented by other manuscripts of equal value.
