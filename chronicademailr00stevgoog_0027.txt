x PREFACE.

it becomes difficult to separate, with accuracy, those passages
which can be referred to the monk of Melrose from those
which are the propertyof the monk of Durham. It is believed,
however, that such passages may be traced3 and to do so it will
be necessary to find in the Chronicle of Melrose passages, or
peculiarities of diction or of arrangement, which, although exist-
ing in the Saxon, do not appear in the other chronicles which
are founded upon that venerable authority* It must be owned,
however, that these isolated scraps of translation, even if col-
lected with the greatest care, would amount to no great bulk;
and, bearing such a small proportion to the numerous and ob-
vious extracta from Latin writers whose histories have reached
us in an entire form, they cannot add very much to the value
of the early portion of our chronicle.

It is obvious from the notes appended to this edition, that
very much of the part professedly a compilation, is to be re-

Richard of Hexham in 7883 Simeon and Hoveden omit the year; the
chron. Melr. agrees with the Saron.

794. The last sentence in this year adherea closely to the Saxon; Simeon,

797. The sentence concerning pope Leo is a close version of the Saxom Si·
meon’s narrative, placed under the year 799, iscousiderably amplified3
Florence gives the sense, but in different words, and further removed
from the diction of the originali Hoveden omits it entirely. ’

800. The sentence “ rex Karolus,” ete, is taken, almost verbatim, from a Latin
notice in the Laud manuscript of the saxon Chroniole, aversion which
the compilet seems to have followed 3 it is amplified and clothed in very
different language by Simeonr Hoveden omits it. ,

833. This year ie omitted by Simeon; Florence has it, but in an abridged form;
Hoveden nearly agreeswith the Chron. Melr., butis less correct and close
in malating from the Saron. ·

851. The notice of the Danish invasion is probably a direct extract from the
Sar. Chronicle, although F lorence’e narrative approaches nearly to the
same source3 Simeon and Hoveden gire it differently.

866. The use of the word “ degenerem,” in our chronicle, is worthy of noticer
