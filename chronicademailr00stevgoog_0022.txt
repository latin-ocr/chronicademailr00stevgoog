of error, confusion, and contradiction, it is impossible to avoid
arriving at the conviction that the celebrated author of the
Scottish Historical Library has written his notice of this im-
portant chronicle without giving himself the trouble of examin-

only ancient copy of whose existence we have any proof; and
it is equally clear that the “ Scottish MSS? are mere abridged
and recent transcripts frorn this original.

The Oxford edition, although not meriting the character
which we have seen has been bestowed upon it,2is yet by no
means satisfactory. Without intending to derogate from the
respect due to the learned editor under whose name the XV.
